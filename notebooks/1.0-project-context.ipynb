    "So we got some data. More precisely we got some image data which was recorded by a RaspberryPi with camera module. The pictures depict a home garden, see example pictures 1 and 2. We have quite a lot of pictures, over **120k** using about more than **400GB** of disk space. Images were captured about **every other minute over one year**, not taking any pictures when a certain darkness level was reached."

    "However, as in most data sets the data is not as clean as we would wish it is. So it is with this dataset. While skimming through the data we can find some images not showing the garden, but having the shutter closed, see following examples. Although, there were a certain kind of darkness threshold to exclude pictures taken at night, this darkness level was not reached."
