    "# Create Time-Lapse Video at Noon\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can create the time-lapse video, we must select images which should be present in the video. We already did this, using only one image for each day of the year, around 12am and 1pm, see [image-selection-noon](./1.0-image-selection-noon.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the image selection process, was a list of images potentially selected for the time-lapse video. Why potentially? Because we do not know whether the selected images correspond to the *open* or *closed* class, yet. For this we use our already trained *logistic-regression* model to determine the class of each image. Once we classified each image, we can create our time-lapse video, considering only images related to the *open* class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We load our pre-trained model from the filesystem and predict the class for each image in the image directory given to the model. Features must not be extracted manually, this will automatically be done by the special prediction method call."
